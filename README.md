# NDepend Badges

**This project creates status badges that display code metrics from [NDepend](https://www.ndepend.com/) reports.** Badges are similar in style to those created by [badgen.net](https://badgen.net/) and [shields.io](https://shields.io/).

```cs
var report = new Report("NDependTrendData.xml");
report.MakeBadges(report.LatestMetrics, "badges/");
```
